# Flight-Data-Visualization-with-Tableau
This Tableau file contains information on all U.S. airline flights from 2010 and 2011.

Questions raised and answers solved are as follows:

A quick viz (visualization) of flights over time shows a drop of more than 300,000 flights from 2010 to 2011 Ans. Because there is no data for 2011 December. And for each month the average flight is around 300,000, which could be the reason.

You are interested in identifying days that are particularly light in terms of travel each year. Are there particular holidays that seem to experience substantially lower numbers of flights? Use annotations on your viz to show those specific days. Ans. There are couple holidays that have lower numbers of flights such as Independence Day of 2010, Christmas Holidays for both years, and Labor Day for 2011

Next, you want to know who operates the most flights. Is there one airline that operated more flights than any other single airline for each week in this dataset? Show viz. Ans. Southwest operated the most flights on each week throughout the two years.

You would also like to know which states tend to experience the longest departure delays. Create a map that visualizes the departure delay that you can expect in each origin state. Allow the user to filter by airline. Ans. Can be found in the VIZ
